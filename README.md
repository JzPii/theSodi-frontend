# Project Brief: `the Sodi Project`


Sodi simply is a Social-dining app. A booth of 4 people will meet up and talk about the same interest.

### Motivations + Problems

*Why is this project useful? Why were you interested in working on it? What hair-on-fire problems do you see?*

The idea for Sodi was born on a day when I decided to quit my job as a banker. Think about this, going to an event or a conference would take me a whole morning, talk to right people that sharing the same interest is the good point but again it takes lots of time.
So why dont you just list things you like on the table and if they're match with other people then let's do the talking while dining or drinking?

One problem is 

The reason why I wanna do this because I wanna talk to people with different field rather than just co-workers. Or sometimes just a movie that kén người xem? 




### Key Features and Technical Implementation Plan

*Here, list out the key parts that you'll have to build and challenges that you foresee. Give the most details on what you think is the most special to your app.*


* An User's profile:
    * profile pictures
    * background
    * interested in:

* Each table contains:
    * background of everyone
    * Users have the same (or close) interest
    * A chatroom of course

* Mobile Friendly. Everyone has cell phones, so we create our app as a PWA. 
    * React-based PWA which works offline when possible.

* Filtering / Searching
    * filtering/searching a list of table to join.
